# Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-learning

Authors: Hado van Hasselt, Authur Guez, David Silver

Year: 2015

Algorithm: Double DQN

- Problem
  - The standard Q-learning algorithm tends to overestimate action values under certain conditions. Such overestimations are common and harmful to performance, but can be prevented.
- Hypothesis
  - Double DQN
